PyStolovina is a graphical simulation of a sequential game written in a programming language Python. <br>
The main window of the application shows a two-dimensional map of the fields on which agents move
one ours and at least one opponent agent.

The task was to implement algorithms for sequential games, such as Minimax, Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, MaxN, and Expectimax Algorithm.
